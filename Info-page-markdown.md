## Introduction
I am currently in my third semester in my master's degree, with a major in Philosophy and a minor in Psychology. The combination of these fields allows me to apply analytical philosophical thinking and method with current psychological areas of interest and other popular subjects within the field. In the paragraphs below, I will explain what I have recently been working with within my areas of study and give some insight into what else is being conducted within the field of philosophy as of recent.

## Current philosophical subjects of study
Many non-philosophers believe that philosophy is mainly old classical texts and theses, that are in the realm of **Continental Philosophy** and metaphysics; but in reality, we study and conceptually analyze many current and relevant problems and situations, mainly through what is called **Analytical Philosophy**.

Here are my favorite areas of study that are currently very relevant and popular as research in the field of philosophy:

- AI ethics and application  
- Psychiatry and the classification of mental disorders and their symptoms  
- Consequences and responsibilities of the human footprint and climate change in the Anthropocene  
- Models of language and its influence on the mind and on society / how language shapes the mind  
- Assisted suicide ethics and bodily autonomy  
- Bio-ethics and health  

(Socratica, 2024)

Recently, I have been working within the realm of **Analytical Philosophy** on some of my assignments. Here I have amongst others written a critique of the DSM-5 (*Diagnostic and Statistical manual of Mental Disorders*), for not including specific, and very common, symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder, with a focus on the concepts of derealization and depersonalization. I find projects like these interesting, because they let me combine both my fields and let me develop a concrete area of focus, where I can use methods from both Philosophy and Psychology. This also allows me to see points of view, that would not become apparent to me, without insight into both these disciplines. Another assignment I have recently written, focused on the significance of moral development through immersive virtual storytelling and agency in video games and its relation to feelings of empathy and guilt, based on Philosopher Martha Nussbaums *Love's Knowledge* (1990). This was also very exciting, as it allowed me again to combine Philosophy and Psychology in a meaningful manner and apply that new-found knowledge to something contemporary and popular, such as video games. For my masters dissertation next semester, I am planning to write another cross-field analysis on the differences between necessary existential suffering and pathological human suffering. So once more, I get to include knowledge of both my major and minor fields of study.

Analytic philosophy has influenced many other fields, such as **cognitive science**, **linguistics**, **environmental science**, and is recently very present in creating theoretical foundations for the use and development of **artificial intelligence** and **robotic science** (*Table of Contents* (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), 2025). Our methods are often applied to problems in these areas, which foster interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration. Therefore, the belief, that philosophy belongs to the past, is far outdated and neglecting the philosophical traditions would lead to a loss for many scientific disciplines.

## How I initially became interested in my field

While I have up until now presented the reader for the contemporary influence of Philosophy, with a focus on the analytical tradition, I do want to present the concept of **Continental Philosophy** in depth also. While not as popular today, it is the foundation for most prominent philosophical thinking throughout history (*Socratica*, 2024). It encompasses the great philosophical traditions of thinking, and we have to credit it for its influence on the many other sciences that have followed from its original line of thought. As an academic discipline, it encompasses for example; **idealism**, **existentialism**, **nihilism**, **metaphysics**, **phenomenology**, **post structuralism** and others (*Table of Contents* (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), 2025).
Opposed to the analytical tradition, the continental tradition confronts fundamental questions of life such as: *"what does it mean to be human?"*, *"What is the meaning of freedom, life, suffering and death?"*, *"How can we perceive the world as a thing-in-it-self?"* (*Socratica*, 2024). Besides having a huge influential impact on traditions of thinking, it has also majorly impacted modern and postmodern literature and art, inspired some of the most well-known psychoanalysts, and helped shape political movements such as Marxism and feminist politics (*Socratica*, 2024) and helped question societal conflicts.

Many of us are, when first reading or studying philosophical texts, introduced to continental Philosophy. It is also here, that my interest in the field first awakened. I specifically took interest in existentialism - and its questions on human existence and the absence of inherent meaning to life itself. I personally found existentialism interesting, because it tackles philosophy at its most personal and urgent level: *What it means to be a human being*. It emphasizes freedom and responsibility, but in a way that may be terrifying, because it forces us to deal with the consequences of our existence and our personal choices. This, I think, resonates strongly in a modern world, wherein tradition, religion, and authority no longer provide sufficient means of explanation and reassurance for many individuals. In this way it captures the modern human condition.

## The future of Philosophy and philosophical thought

Since philosophy and philosophical thought have been ingrained in such a wide field of other disciplines, philosophy is no longer isolated in its own abstract debates; instead it is engaging with empirical research and technological and societal change. Therefore it is also likely to believe, that the future of philosophy is to be found in interdisciplinary thought and analysis and creating dialogue across disciplines. Furthermore, in a world facing different modes of crisis, such as climate change, global inequality and huge technological shifts, questions of meaning, freedom, and justice are becoming more and more prevalent and urgent, as it were in earlier philosophical thought. This may give rise to a revival of existentialist, critical, and ethical thought, that applies to current real-world problems.

## Use of digital technologies in my field

One of the major uses of digital technologies in my field, is data search via online databases such as AU library (*Det Kgl. Bibliotek*, n.d.), JSTOR (*JSTOR*, n.d.), Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (*Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*, n.d.) and others. A big part of my field is searching for and reading about relevant material, so that we can become sufficiently informed about the subject that we want to write about. Therefore, we also use digtital technologies that ensure that we search in the right places - sometimes this can also happen through website functions such as Google Scholar. As previously mentioned, AI also plays a more and more prominent role in our current subjects of Philosophy; when researching, analyzing, and writing about AI technology, we have to actually make use of AIs in order to collect data about their own functions, so in this way, AI technology becomes central to the entire process itself. On the other hand, AI also have the possibility to disrupt the entire process of how Philosophy is done, since it opens up new possibilities of using AI in the process of both research (we can use AI to present us to relevant material for our research), in the process of brainstorming subjects of our studies, and even in coming up with conclusions of arguments (which is a huge part of Philosophy)(Storozhyk, 2024). 
In one of my earlier projects I also made use of Virtual Reality in the process of data-collection, and I imagine that this could be very useful in the future of Philosophical subjects - for example are there big ethical discussions of the (re-)creation of previously deceased loved ones through Virtual Reality. The same is the case with AI- and Robo-ethics. In a practical sense, we also make use of digital technologies in the shape of virtual learning platforms, such as for example streaming of online lectures and/or educational videos on digital platforms. My field of study is definitely not immune to technological change, even though at first glance Philosophy can look like it mostly consist of reading thick books and writing long texts manually. Digital technologies has already changed the way of doing Philosophy - many books and articles are being read online now and many of our learning platforms has become digitalized. While this change has been slow and gradual, I believe that VR and AI already has made a fast change within the field of Philosophy for the first time ever, and with new digital technologies popping up and evolving every day now, our field can still change along them. This is a good thing, if it is used correctly. We must still make sure, that our discussions and arguments are not faulty, since AI is still developing and it can often come to wrong conclusions and provide us with wrong citations of authors. Luckily, a big part of education in our field is critical thinking and making sure that we create sound arguments based on concrete evidence and citations. For this reason I believe, that digital technologies can become a priceless addition to our field, when used properly.

## Conclusion

As it has been presented in this paper, the use of digital technologies already has big influence within the realm of Philosophical thought and practice. This former is seen throughout the subjects and fields that are often studied and explored through Philosophical practice. The latter is apparent as a part of the entire way that philosophical practice is performed. This is cause for both new possibilities of research, but also for new problems that must be uncovered and examined, so that we ensure that our ways of practicing Philosophy is improved with the use of new digital technologies, instead of worsened, as it can happen if we are not critical in the use of these technologies.
