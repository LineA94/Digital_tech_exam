## The implementation of an API

The abbreviation **API** stands for **"Application Programming Interface"** (*What is an API?*, 2025). APIs are sets of automated protocols that are able to allow “[…] different software components to communicate and transfer data” (*What is an API?*, 2025). 

This can be a very effective feature on a website, since it allows, through small chunks of code for different pieces of software, to work together in order to for example enhance user experience and business efficiency, but also for things such as enhancing online security on an app or a website. 

APIs have been around for decades, and we interact with them every day on websites across the internet; they are used on sales platforms, social media platforms, on cloud services, on mobile applications, and also on devices that are able to connect to other external objects, such as cameras and microphones (*What is an API?*, 2025).

They work by sharing data through request–response cycles. When a user interacts with an API client, by for example pressing a button or searching for a specific term on a website, a request is sent to obtain the specific piece of needed data. The API server then retrieves this data from its resource and returns it to the user on the original website that was interacted with (*What is an API?*, 2025).

I have implemented an API on this website by inserting a small “chunk of code” as described above, which you can try here to see how it works in practice:
