## The implementation of an API

The abbreviation **API** stands for **"Application Programming Interface"** (*What is an API?*, 2025). APIs are sets of automated protocols that allow “[…] different software components to communicate and transfer data” (*What is an API?*, 2025). 

This can be a very effective feature on a website, since it allows small chunks of code to enable different pieces of software to work together—for example, to enhance user experience and business efficiency, but also to improve online security on an app or website.

APIs have been around for decades, and we interact with them every day on websites across the internet; they are used on sales platforms, social media platforms, cloud services, mobile applications, and devices that connect to external objects such as cameras and microphones (*What is an API?*, 2025).

They work by sharing data through request–response cycles. When a user interacts with an API client—for example, by pressing a button or searching for a specific term on a website—a request is sent to obtain the needed data. The API server retrieves this data from its resource and returns it to the user on the original website (*What is an API?*, 2025).

I have implemented an API on this website by inserting a small “chunk of code” as described above, which you can try here to see how it works in practice:
