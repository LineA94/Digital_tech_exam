## Github and its role in creating this website

**Github** is an open-source online environment platform, which functions as a space where users can store and share code in order to help others create code themselves, but also so that others may inspect your shared code, and post questions regarding the code, in order to help you troubleshoot and repair code that is not working optimally or at all, which promotes collaboration between users (Beshero-Bondar & Parker, 2017). **Git** itself is a *version control system* (Beshero-Bondar & Parker, 2017) and Github works as a social tool built on this *version control system*. 

What is meant by "version control system" is that it allows its users to manage changes to files and does so by storing versions of all the different varieties that the file has existed as, present and previously. This means that the user is also able to restore previous versions of the files and see who made the changes (Beshero-Bondar & Parker, 2017). Another important feature is Github’s ability to create *branches*. This allows users to work on the same project without altering or potentially breaking the main project.

The projects stored on Github are restored in what is called **repositories** (Beshero-Bondar & Parker, 2017). These are remote folders that work as the user's personal portfolio for projects and track all the changes made to the user's code.  

In the case of this website, I used Github to deploy my website (HTML and CSS) as part of a repository, which made this website available — this is made possible through Github Pages (Beshero-Bondar & Parker, 2017).

## Conclusion

Many components are necessary in order to create a website. On this particular (although very simple) website, you can see how the use of coding language, Application Programming Interfaces, and GitHub can be used in practice when creating and launching a website.
