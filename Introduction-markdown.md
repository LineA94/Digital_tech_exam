## Introduction

In order to create a functional website, multiple criteria must be met. In the sections below, I will explain the features incorporated on this website, in order to give an understanding of why these are necessary and how I have used them.

## HTML and CSS

When creating a website, it is necessary to write code in languages that are specifically designed to create and design websites. One of these languages is HTML.
**HTML** should be thought of as the structure of the website, since it is a standard form of markup language for creating websites (*HTML Tutorial*, 2025). This is what allows us to create the actual content presented on the webpage, whether this be through creating new headings, paragraphs, or presentation of pictures, or more complex features such as for example the integration of buttons, search bars, or other interactive user features (*HTML Tutorial*, 2025).  

**CSS** is instead the language that is used in order to style the website (*CSS Tutorial*, 2025). It therefore allows us to create websites that are aesthetically pleasing and engaging to interact with. For example, we can make changes in color templates, text font families and sizes, or create complex gradients and shapes (*CSS Tutorial*, 2025). Both HTML and CSS should therefore be present as components when creating a website, as it has also been done on this website.
