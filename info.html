<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In order to create a functional website, multiple criteria must be met. In the sections below, I will explain the features incoporated on this website, in order to give an understanding of why these are necessary and how I have used them.</p>

<h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
<p>In order to create a website, it is necessary to write code in languages, that are specifically designed to create and design websites.
<b>HTML</b> should be thought of as the structure of the website, since it is a standard form of markup language for creating websites (<i>HTML Tutorial</i>, 2025). This is what allows us to create the actual content presented on the webpage, whether this be thorugh creating new headings, paragraphs or presentation of pictures, or more complex features such as for example the integration of buttons, searchbars, or other interactive user feautures (<i>HTML Tutorial</i>, 2025).
<b>CSS</b> is instead the language that is used in order to style the website (<i>CSS Tutorial</i>, 2025). It therefore allows us to create websites that are aesthetically pleasing and engaging to interact with. For example can we make a change in color templates, texts font families and sizes, or create complex gradients and shapes (<i>CSS Tutorial</i>, 2025). Both HMTL and CSS should therefore be present as components when creating a website, as it has been done on this website also.</p>

<div class="textbox"><h2>The implementation of an API</h2>
<p>The abbrivation <b>API</b> stands for "<b>Application Programming Interface</b>" (<i>What is an API?</i>, 2025). APIs are sets of automated protocols that are able to allow "[...] different software components to communicate and transfer data" (<i>What is an API?</i>, 2025). This can be a very effective feature on a website, since it allows through small chunks of code for different pieces of software to work together in order to for example enhance user experience and business efficiency, but also for things such as enhancing online security on an app or a website. APIs have been around for centuries, and we interact with them everyday on websites on the internet; they are used on sales platforms, social media platforms, on cloud services, on mobile applications and also on devices which are able to connect to objects, such as for example cameras and microphones (<i>What is an API?</i>, 2025). The way they work is by data sharing through request and respond cycles - when a user interacts with an API client by for example pressing a button or searching a sepcific term on a website, a request is sent to obtain the specific piece of data. Then the API server retrieves the needed data from its ressource and this data is then returned to the user back on the website that was originally interacted with (<i>What is an API?</i>, 2025). <br>
I have implemented an API on this website by inserting a small "chunk of code" as described above, which you can try here in order to see how they work in practice: </p>

<h2>Github and its role in creating this website</h2>
<p><b>Github</b> is an open-source online environment platform, which functions as a space where users can store and share code in order to help others create code themselves, but also so that others may inspect your shared code, and post questions regarding the code, in order to help you troubleshoot and repair code that is not working optimally or at all, which promotes collaboration between users (Beshero-Bondar & Parker, 2017). <b>Git</b> itself is a <i>version control system</i> (Beshero-Bondar & Parker, 2017) and Github works as a social tool build on this <i>version control system</i>. What is meant by "version control system" is that it allows its users to manage changes to files and does so by storing versions of all the different varieties, that the file has existed as present and previously. This means, that the user is also able to restore previous versions of the files and see who made the changes (Beshero-Bondar & Parker, 2017). Another important feature is Githubs ability to create <i>branches</i>. This allows users to work on the same project, without altering or potentially breaking the main project.
The projects stored on Github are restored in what is called <b>repositories</b> (Beshero-Bondar & Parker, 2017). These are remote folders that work as the users personal portfolio for projects and track all the changes made to the users code. <br>
In the case of this website, I used Github to deploy my website (HMTL and CSS) as part of a repository, which made this website available - this is made possible through Github Pages site (Beshero-Bondar & Parker, 2017).
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many components are necessary in order to create a website. On this particular (although very simple) website, you can see how the use of coding language, Application Programming Interfaces and GitHub can be used in practice, when creating and launching a website.
